invaders-from-space
===================

A simple space invaders clone created for a workshop at a DigiMakers video-game themed event. The workshop is all about learning some more medium / advanced Python techniques, but is still aimed at beginners.

The aim is that, with guidance, keen Python learners can reproduce something similar to this in an hour. Apart from all the docstrings. Those would take a while to type.

Requirements
------------
This clone requires the [pyglet graphics library](http://www.pyglet.org).
